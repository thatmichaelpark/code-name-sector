<h2>What is <i>Code Name: Sector</i>?</h2>
<p>(I'll just abbreviate it as <i>CN:S</i>.) <i>CN:S</i> is an HTML5 version of an old computer/board game of the same name.
The original <i>CN:S</i> was published by Parker Brothers in 1977. The human player(s) plotted on the game board the positions
of four destroyers on as they sought out a computer-controlled submarine.
