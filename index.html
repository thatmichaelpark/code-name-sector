<h2>What is <i>Code Name: Sector</i>?</h2>
<p>(I'll just abbreviate it as <i>CN:S</i>.) <i>CN:S</i> is an HTML5 version of an old computer/board game of the same name.
The original <i>CN:S</i> was published by Parker Brothers in 1977. The human player(s) plotted on the game board the positions
of four destroyers on as they sought out a computer-controlled submarine.

<h2>How does this version differ from the original?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of a board and crayons, you can plot on the computer screen.</li>
<li>There is an auto-plot (not auto-pilot) option which will plot automatically.</li>
<li>Eight LEDs to indicate direction instead of four.</li>
</ul>
