<h2>What is <i>Code Name: Sector</i>?</h2>
<p>(I'll just abbreviate it as <i>CN:S</i>.) <i>CN:S</i> is an HTML5 version of an old computer/board game of the same name.
The original <i>CN:S</i> was published by Parker Brothers in 1977. The human player(s) plotted on the game board the positions
of four destroyers on as they sought out a computer-controlled submarine.

<h2>How does this version differ from the original?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using a board and crayons, you can plot on the computer screen.</li>
<li>There is an option to have the computer plot automatically. This can be turned on or off at any time.</li>
<li>When firing a torpedo, select a depth from a drop-down instead of waiting for the depth to flash on the display.</li>
<li>Direction is indicated by eight "LEDs" instead of four.</li>
<li>Changing the type of game requires clicking RESTART.</li>
<li>Sub Finder is not implemented.</li>
</ul>
