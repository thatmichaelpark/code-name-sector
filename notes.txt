A few implementation notes for future reference.

CN:S is written in HTML5 and Javascript.

There are three main divs in the html:
* The "panel", which contains a canvas element (for the 7-segment display and compass) and the button controls.
* The "chart", which contains three canvas elements and drawing controls.
* The "log", which is used for text output.

There are three Javascript files:
* chart.js, which handles graphics and user interaction on the chart div.
* display.js, which handles the 7-segment display and compass.
* game.js, which handles game play in a state machine that is driven by input from the panel buttons.

The chart consists of three layered canvas elements. The bottom canvas is where the grid lines are drawn; the top layer is where the rubberband line is drawn when the user is dragging the mouse; the middle layer is where the rubberband lines (and computer-controlled plotting, if auto-plot is enabled) are drawn. The eraser effects only the middle layer.
